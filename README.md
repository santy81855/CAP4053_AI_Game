# Concept
- You play through 3 progressively more diffuclt levels as a glass cannon protecting a treasure chest. If you let an enemy touch the treasure chest then you will explode and restart the level.
- You have access to an item shop where you can buy powerups with the coins you earn by hitting the enemies.
